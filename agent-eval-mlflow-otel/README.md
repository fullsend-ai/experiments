# Experiment: Agent Evaluation via MLflow + OpenTelemetry

**Date:** 2026-06-09
**Status:** Complete
**Authors:** @ascerra

Evaluates whether MLflow 3.x + OpenTelemetry can serve as a complete evaluation platform for autonomous AI agents in an SDLC pipeline — replacing ad-hoc "merge and hope" with instrumented, scored, regression-tested prompt changes.

Related: [fullsend-ai/fullsend#1682](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/fullsend/pull/1682) — functional eval pattern (complementary work)

> **Internal:** The production versions of these scripts (harness, scorers, trace export, CI workflows) live at [fullsend-ai/features](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/features). The examples here are simplified, standalone excerpts.

## Hypothesis

A single platform (MLflow) combined with OpenTelemetry trace instrumentation can:

1. **Capture** rich agent execution traces (tool calls, reasoning turns, cost, tokens) without modifying the agent runtime
2. **Score** those traces with both mechanical (free, instant) and LLM-as-judge (semantic) scorers
3. **Gate PRs** by triggering real agent runs against test fixtures and blocking merges that degrade quality
4. **Detect regressions** in production via daily comparison against curated golden baselines
5. **Version prompts** with staging/production aliases tied to git commits, enabling prompt-to-output lineage

If all five hold, teams can treat prompt engineering like software engineering — with CI, regression tests, and quality dashboards.

## Background

### The problem

Fullsend agents (triage, code, review, fix, retro ... eventually explore, refine, critique) run autonomously in sandboxed containers. When someone changes an agent prompt, there is:

- No quality metric — "did the explore agent get better at finding context?"
- No regression detection — a subtle change could break decomposition quality silently
- No before/after comparison — every PR is an opinion with zero supporting data

### Prior art evaluated

| Tool/Approach | Finding |
|---------------|---------|
| [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com) | Strong trace UI and evals, but no built-in prompt registry or alias-based versioning. OTLP ingest supported. |
| MLflow 3.x | OTLP traces, prompt versioning, quality dashboard, evaluation runs, datasets — all in one |

MLflow 3.x was chosen because it natively accepts OTLP traces, has a built-in Prompts Registry with aliasing, and its `genai.evaluate()` API logs Feedback objects that populate a Quality Dashboard without custom visualization work.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- MLflow 3.x instance with OTLP ingest enabled (`/v1/traces` endpoint)
- Python 3.12+ with: `mlflow>=3.3`, `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http`
- Anthropic SDK with Vertex AI support (`anthropic[vertex]`) for LLM judges
- GitHub Actions for CI (eval-gate, eval-monitor workflows)

### Key design decisions

1. **Post-hoc trace export, not live instrumentation** — The agent runtime (sandbox) has no OTEL SDK. Instead, bash scripts record timing/IDs to JSONL files, and `send-trace.py` reconstructs the span tree after the run completes. This avoids coupling the agent to any observability library.

2. **Harness YAML as single source of truth** — Each agent's eval configuration (scorers, gates, baselines) lives in its harness YAML alongside the agent config. `harness.py` resolves scorer names to Python functions at runtime.

3. **Hybrid scoring** — Mechanical scorers are instant and free (pure Python checks on trace attributes). LLM judges run Claude Opus via Vertex AI for semantic quality evaluation. Both feed into the same MLflow Feedback system.

4. **Fixture-based PR gates** — When a prompt changes, the CI triggers a real agent run against a known test issue, then scores the resulting trace. This is an n=1 smoke test, not statistical significance — production monitoring provides the longer-term signal.

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: Capture — VALIDATED

Rich traces are captured for all three agent types without modifying the agent runtime. The span tree for a typical explore run contains 15-25 spans including:

| Span category | Examples | Count |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| Pipeline phases | pre-explore, post-explore | 4-6 |
| Fullsend lifecycle | load-harness, create-sandbox, agent-execution, validation | 6-8 |
| Agent reasoning | reasoning-1 through reasoning-N | 3-10 |
| Tool calls | tool:WebSearch, tool:Read, tool:Write | 5-15 |
| Results | fullsend:results | 1 |

Token counts (input/output), cost ($), latency (ms), and model name are logged as span attributes. Cross-run linking via OTEL Links connects explore → refine → critique traces.

### Hypothesis 2: Score — VALIDATED

13 scorers implemented across two tiers:

| Tier | Count | Avg latency | Cost |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| Mechanical | 5 | <100ms | $0 |
| LLM Judge (Claude Opus) | 8 | 3-8s each | ~$0.02/scorer/trace |

Scorers receive `mlflow.entities.Trace` objects and return `Feedback` with value + rationale. MLflow's Quality Dashboard aggregates these automatically.

**Key metric ranges observed (explore agent, n=15 traces):**

| Scorer | Mean | Min | Max |
|--------|------|-----|-----|
| validation_passed | 0.85 | 0.0 | 1.0 |
| tool_efficiency | 0.50 | 0.15 | 0.83 |
| cost_within_budget | 1.00 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| confidence_coherence | 1.00 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| reasoning_coherence | 0.71 | 0.40 | 1.0 |
| explore_context_quality | 0.72 | 0.40 | 1.0 |

### Hypothesis 3: PR Gate — VALIDATED

The eval-gate workflow successfully:
1. Detected prompt changes in the PR diff (7s)
2. Registered `@staging` prompt version in MLflow (~60s)
3. Triggered a real agent run against fixture issue (~10 min)
4. Scored the resulting trace (mechanical + LLM judge)
5. Posted pass/fail verdict to the PR as a comment
6. Blocked merge when quality dropped below threshold

**PR #92 fixture eval result:** LLM judge score 4.0/5, cost $0.36, all mechanical checks passed. Total wall time: ~12 minutes.

### Hypothesis 4: Regression Detection — VALIDATED (with caveats)

Daily monitoring workflow:
- Scores last 7 days of production traces per agent
- Compares against golden baseline means (10% regression threshold)
- Sends Slack alert with per-agent, per-scorer breakdown

**Caveat:** Golden baselines require manual curation. `create_golden.py` selects diverse traces and scores them, but the quality of the baseline depends on the quality of the traces available. Small n (< 10 traces) makes the baseline noisy.

### Hypothesis 5: Prompt Versioning — VALIDATED

MLflow Prompts Registry successfully tracks:
- Version history per agent (explore at v4, refine at v3, critique at v2)
- `@staging` alias set on PR, `@production` on merge
- Git commit + branch metadata per version
- Prompt-to-trace lineage via `link_prompt_versions_to_trace()`

The Compare tab allows side-by-side diff of any two prompt versions.

## Analysis

### What worked well

1. **OTLP ingest is seamless** — MLflow accepts standard OTLP traces without any MLflow-specific SDK in the agent. This means the instrumentation works with any MLflow deployment.

2. **Quality Dashboard is production-ready** — Once Feedbacks are logged via `genai.evaluate()`, the dashboard shows distributions, trends, and drill-down without custom visualization.

3. **Hybrid scoring is the right model** — Mechanical scorers catch structural failures instantly (invalid JSON, budget blown, too many retries). LLM judges catch semantic issues (poor context quality, incoherent reasoning). Neither alone is sufficient.

4. **Fixture-based PR gates give immediate signal** — Even with n=1, a 4/5 judge score on a known test case gives more confidence than "I think this prompt is better."

### What required iteration

1. **Session metadata via OTLP is fragile** — The `session.id` span attribute gets JSON-serialized with extra quotes by MLflow's OTLP ingester. Required a post-export patch via `deprecated_end_trace_v2()`. This is a known MLflow bug.

2. **Cross-run trace linking needed custom work** — OTEL Links are supported but MLflow's UI doesn't render them prominently. The session grouping (`mlflow.trace.session` tag) is more useful for the UI than the Link relationship.

3. **LLM judge calibration is ongoing** — The rubric scoring criteria need iteration. Initial judge prompts were too lenient (everything scored 4-5). Adding specific anchor descriptions for each score level improved discrimination.

4. **Golden baseline bootstrapping is cold-start problem** — You need production traces to create baselines, but you need baselines to detect regressions. We bootstrapped from early runs and plan to refresh quarterly.

### Limitations

- **Fixture eval is n=1** — A single test issue does not prove statistical significance. It's a smoke test.
- **LLM judge reproducibility** — Same trace scored twice can produce different scores (±0.5 typical). Averaging multiple judge runs would improve reliability but increases cost.
- **No inline regression on PR** — The PR gate tests the new prompt against a fixture, not against recent production traces. A prompt could pass the fixture but regress on real-world variety.
- **Cost** — LLM judges at ~$0.02/scorer/trace means scoring 100 traces with 8 judges costs ~$16. Acceptable for daily monitoring, expensive for bulk historical analysis.

### MLflow features not used

| Feature | Why not |
|---------|---------|
| MLflow Datasets API | Golden baselines stored as JSONL files, not uploaded via API. Could migrate for better UI integration. |
| MLflow Sessions UI (dedicated page) | Sessions tab returned 404 in our deployment (MLflow 3.12.0). Trace-level session column works. |
| Model Registry | Agents are not "models" in the traditional sense. Prompts Registry covers our versioning needs. |
| MLflow Deployments / AI Gateway | Not needed — agents deploy via GitHub Actions, not MLflow serving. |

## Recommendation

Adopt this pattern for any team running autonomous AI agents:

1. **Instrument first** — Add OTEL trace export to agent pipelines. The post-hoc pattern (collect artifacts, reconstruct spans) avoids coupling agents to observability libraries.

2. **Start with mechanical scorers** — They're free, instant, and catch the most obvious failures (invalid output, budget blown, excessive retries).

3. **Add LLM judges for semantic quality** — But calibrate the rubric carefully. Anchor each score level with specific descriptions.

4. **Gate PRs with fixture evals** — Even n=1 against a known test case provides meaningful signal. Trust production monitoring for statistical confidence.

5. **Use prompt versioning** — The `@staging` / `@production` alias pattern gives a clean promotion lifecycle tied to git commits.
